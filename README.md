# Unexpected Mutability in F#

This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in F# programming related to mutable variables. The `bug.fs` file contains code that showcases incorrect assumptions about mutability leading to unexpected results.  The `bugSolution.fs` file provides a corrected version, highlighting best practices for handling mutable variables.

This example serves as a reminder to carefully consider when mutability is necessary and to avoid unexpected side effects.
